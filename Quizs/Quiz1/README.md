Types: Types define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated in a programming language. Common types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

Variables: Variables are named storage locations that hold data values. They have a type that defines the kind of data they can store.

Key Differences:
Concept: A type is a classification of data, while a variable is a storage location associated with a name.
Purpose: Types enforce data integrity and determine the operations that can be performed on data. Variables are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
Usage: You define a variable with a specific type to allocate memory and ensure that only data of that type is stored in that location.
