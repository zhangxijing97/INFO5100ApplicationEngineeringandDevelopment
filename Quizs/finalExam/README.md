# HW to Chapter 15 "SDLC" (as in lectures)

Non-programming Assignment:<br>

1) What is SDLC and what are its steps?<br>

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a systematic process for building software applications. The typical steps in SDLC include:<br>

Requirement Analysis: Gathering and understanding the requirements for the software.<br>
Design: Creating a detailed design plan for how the software will be structured and function.<br>
Implementation: Writing code based on the design specifications.<br>
Testing: Checking the software for bugs and ensuring it meets the requirements.<br>
Deployment: Releasing the software for users.<br>
Maintenance: Providing updates, fixing bugs, and making improvements based on user feedback.<br>

2) List and describe different SDLC types.<br>

There are several types of SDLC models, each with its own approach and emphasis on different aspects of the software development process:<br>

Waterfall Model: Sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It's rigid and linear.<br>

Iterative Model: Development is done in iterations, with each iteration building on the previous one. It allows for feedback and improvements throughout the process.<br>

Agile Model: Focuses on iterative and incremental development. It emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and responding to change.<br>

Spiral Model: Combines elements of both waterfall and iterative development. It involves risk analysis and multiple iterations of development.<br>

V-Model: Similar to waterfall but emphasizes testing. Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.<br>

Prototyping Model: Involves creating a prototype to gather requirements and feedback early in the process.<br>

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model: Emphasizes quick development and iteration using pre-built components.<br>
