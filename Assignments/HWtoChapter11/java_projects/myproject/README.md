# HW to Chapter 11 “Handling Errors, Threads, Lambda”

1) What does construction “try … catch” do?
The construction "try...catch" is used to handle exceptions. It tries to execute a block of code, and if an exception occurs during the execution, it catches and handles it instead of crashing the program.<br>

2) What does it mean when the program throws exceptions?
When a program throws exceptions, it means that something unexpected or erroneous happened during its execution. An exception is like an error message that indicates a problem occurred, and the program may not be able to continue executing as expected.<br>

3) What is a Thread in Java?
In Java, a Thread is a unit of execution that represents a separate flow of control within a program. Threads allow concurrent execution, meaning multiple tasks can be performed simultaneously within the same program. They are used to implement multitasking and handle tasks such as responding to user input while performing background tasks.<br>
