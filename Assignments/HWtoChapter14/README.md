# HW to Chapters 14 “Java GUI - Swing” (as in lectures)

Non-programming Assignment:<br>

1) How can we add GUI to a Java program?<br>

To add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a Java program, you can use either AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) or Swing libraries provided by Java. These libraries allow you to create windows, buttons, text fields, and other visual components that users can interact with. You can start by importing these libraries and then using classes like Frame, Button, TextField, etc., to design and display your GUI.<br>

2) What is AWT - Abstract Windowing Toolkit?<br>

AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) is the original GUI toolkit in Java. It provides a set of classes for creating and managing graphical user interfaces. AWT components are platform-dependent, meaning they use the native GUI components of the underlying operating system. While AWT was the first GUI toolkit in Java, it has some limitations compared to Swing, including fewer components and less flexibility in customization.<br>

3) What is Swing?<br>

Swing is a GUI toolkit in Java that extends the AWT library. Swing provides a rich set of components for building interactive and customizable GUIs. Unlike AWT, Swing components are written entirely in Java, which makes them platform-independent. Swing offers a wide range of components such as buttons, text fields, panels, dialogs, and tables, which can be extensively customized using various look and feel options. Swing is now the preferred choice for developing GUI applications in Java due to its flexibility and consistency across different platforms.<br>
