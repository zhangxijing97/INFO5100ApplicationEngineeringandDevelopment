# HW to Chapter 12 “Reading from and Writing to Files” (as in lectures)

Non-programming Assignment:
1) How to read information from a file?
Open the File: First, you need to open the file you want to read from, which tells your computer where the file is and that you want to look at its contents.<br>

Read the File: Next, you read the file. This can mean looking at all its contents at once or going through it piece by piece, depending on what you need.<br>

Use the Information: After reading, you use the information however you need, like looking at it, making decisions based on it, or using it in some calculations.<br>

Close the File: Finally, you close the file. This tells your computer you're done with the file for now, and it can stop keeping it ready for you.<br>

2) How to write information to a file?

Open/Create the File: Just like reading, you start by opening the file. If the file doesn't exist yet, this step will create it for you. You also decide whether to start fresh (erase anything already there) or add to what's already there.<br>

Write to the File: Now you write your information into the file. This could be anything from a single word to a whole list of things.<br>

Finish Writing: Sometimes, you need to tell your computer you're done adding information to make sure it all gets properly saved.<br>

Close the File: Like with reading, you close the file when you're done. This makes sure all your new information is safely stored and the file is no longer in use.<br>
