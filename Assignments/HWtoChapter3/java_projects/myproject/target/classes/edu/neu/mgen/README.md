# Description of the Java naming convention

Class: Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).<dv>

Interfaces: Interface names should be capitalized like class names.<dv>

Methods: Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.<dv>

Variable: Except for variables, all instance, class, and class constants are in mixed case with a lowercase first letter. Internal words start with capital letters. Variable names should not start with underscore _ or dollar sign $ characters, even though both are allowed.<dv>

Constants: The names of variables declared class constants and of ANSI constants should be all uppercase with words separated by underscores ("_"). (ANSI constants should be avoided, for ease of debugging.)<dv>
